## UMKC Forgetful Wanderers
This project is an implementation of Nine Men's Morris created as a team (named Forgetful Wanderers) for COMP-SCI 449 at UMKC. COMP-SCI 449 is Foundation of Software Engineering; we are focusing more on the *process* of software engineering rather than the actual programming (Git, documentation, team management, Scrum, testing, etc).

### Nine Men's Morris
Nine Men's Morris is an old game that involves two players taking turns placing and moving their pieces ("men") in order to remove their opponent's pieces to win. You can read more about the history and rules of the game at its [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men%27s_morris).
